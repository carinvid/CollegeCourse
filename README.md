# CollegeCourse
create a C++ program using Visual Studio that could be used by a college to track its courses.  In this program, create a CollegeCourse class includes fields representing department, course number, credit hours, and tuition.  Create a child (sub class) class named LabCourse, that inherits all fields from the the CollegeCourse class, includes one more field that holds a lab fee charged in addition to the tuition. Create appropriate functions for these classes, and write a main() function that instantiates and uses objects of each class.
GRADING RUBRIC:

- define a class named “CollegeCourse”
- private fields for department, course number, credit hours, and tuition
- public function(s) setting the private fields
- public function that displays a CollegeCourse's data
- define a class named “LabCourse”
- inherit from CollegeCourse
- include field that holds a lab fee
- public function(s) setting the private field (don't forget the parent)
- public function that displays a LabCourse's data (don't forget the parent)
- main() function that instantiates a LabCourse, populates all private and inherited fields, calls both private and inherited methods
